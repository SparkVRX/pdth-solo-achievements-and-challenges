# PAYDAY: The Heist | Solo Achievements and Challenges
English | Russian

**PAYDAY: The Heist** is a great game with a lot of potential, but it has no place for a solo player. Many achievements/challenges can only be completed in co-op, Overkill 145+ difficulty is only for a full team of strong players, and bots are so bad that it is almost impossible to play with them even on Overkill difficulty. Without other players, you canâ€™t even use crew bonuses. This mod solves all these problems and allows a solo player to complete the game 100%, get genuine pleasure and not resort to using glitches, cheats and other similar tricks.

## Installation and compatibility
This mod should be installed on a clean game, it is incompatible with DAHM/DorHUD and other mods. To install it, you need to extract the contents of the archive (IPHLPAPI.dll, PD2Hook.yml and the mods folder) to the root folder of the game.

## Improved Bots
To be able to play independently without other players even on Overkill difficulty, bots have been improved. Now their capabilities are closer to real players, which compensates for their lack of initiative.

**Shooting**  
*Bots are no longer shy about shooting at long distances, for example to kill snipers.*

**Behavior**  
*Bots now try to stay close to you and not run away.*

**Speed**  
*Bot speed has been doubled.*

## Solo Crew Bonuses
Now, if you play in single player, effect of your crew bonus will affect you.  
In multiplayer, bonuses work as originally intended.

## Solo Achievements and Challenges
